# Supabase Database Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the StudyCollab database using Supabase SQL Editor.

## Prerequisites

âœ… You already have:

- Supabase project created
- `profiles` table with RLS policies
- `avatars` storage bucket
- User creation trigger function

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Run Migration Files in Order

Go to your Supabase Dashboard â†’ SQL Editor and run these files **in order**:

#### Step 1: Create Additional Tables

Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/001_additional_tables.sql` into the SQL Editor and run it.

This will create:

- Custom enums (TaskPriority, TaskStatus, ResourceType, VoteType, GroupRole)
- All application tables (tasks, notes, resources, etc.)
- Indexes for performance
- Update triggers

#### Step 2: Enable Row Level Security

Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/002_rls_policies_additional.sql` into the SQL Editor and run it.

This will:

- Enable RLS on all new tables
- Create security policies for data access control
- Ensure users can only access their own data

#### Step 3: Add Helper Functions

Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/003_additional_functions.sql` into the SQL Editor and run it.

This will create:

- Resource scoring system based on votes
- Self-vote prevention system

### 2. Verify Setup

After running all migrations, verify your setup:

```sql
-- Check that all tables exist
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Check that RLS is enabled on all tables
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND rowsecurity = true;

-- Test the profiles table
SELECT * FROM profiles LIMIT 1;
```

### 3. Test Authentication Flow

1. **Sign up a test user** through your app
2. **Check that profile is created automatically**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM profiles ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```
3. **Test RLS policies** by trying to access data from different users

### 4. Environment Configuration

Make sure your `.env.local` has the correct Supabase configuration:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://rvosteyajdubiwvvhitu.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

## Database Schema Overview

After setup, you'll have these tables:

```
auth.users (Supabase managed)
â”œâ”€â”€ profiles (your existing table)
    â”œâ”€â”€ task_categories
    â”œâ”€â”€ tasks
    â”œâ”€â”€ note_folders
    â”œâ”€â”€ notes
    â”œâ”€â”€ resources
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ votes
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ comments
    â””â”€â”€ study_groups
        â””â”€â”€ group_members
```

## Key Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)

- âœ… Users can only see their own tasks, notes, and categories
- âœ… Resources are public but users can only edit their own
- âœ… Study groups have member-based access control
- âœ… Votes and comments are public but users can only manage their own

### Automatic Functions

- âœ… Profile creation on user signup (already working)
- âœ… Resource score calculation based on votes
- âœ… Prevention of self-voting on resources
- âœ… Automatic timestamp updates

### Storage Integration

- âœ… `avatars` bucket for profile pictures
- âœ… Ready for additional buckets (resources, etc.)

## Testing Your Setup

### 1. Test Profile Creation

```javascript
// In your app, sign up a new user and check if profile is created
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
  email: 'test@example.com',
  password: 'password123',
  options: {
    data: { name: 'Test User' },
  },
})
```

### 2. Test RLS Policies

```javascript
// Try to create a task for the authenticated user
const { data, error } = await supabase.from('tasks').insert({
  title: 'Test Task',
  description: 'Testing RLS',
  priority: 'MEDIUM',
  status: 'TODO',
})
```

### 3. Test Resource Voting

```javascript
// Create a resource and try to vote on it
const { data: resource } = await supabase
  .from('resources')
  .insert({
    title: 'Test Resource',
    description: 'Testing resource creation',
    type: 'PDF',
    subject: 'Computer Science',
  })
  .select()
  .single()

// Try to vote (should fail if it's your own resource)
const { error } = await supabase.from('votes').insert({
  type: 'UPVOTE',
  resource_id: resource.id,
})
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Migration fails**: Check if you have the correct permissions and run migrations in order
2. **RLS blocking queries**: Ensure you're authenticated when testing
3. **Profile not created**: Check if the trigger function is working
4. **Can't vote on resources**: This is expected behavior for your own resources

### Useful SQL Queries:

```sql
-- Check RLS policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- Check triggers
SELECT * FROM information_schema.triggers WHERE trigger_schema = 'public';

-- Check functions
SELECT * FROM information_schema.routines WHERE routine_schema = 'public';
```

## Next Steps

After completing the database setup:

1. âœ… Test user registration and profile creation
2. âœ… Verify RLS policies are working
3. âœ… Test CRUD operations for all entities
4. âœ… Set up file upload for resources (if needed)
5. âœ… Add sample data for development

Your database is now ready for the StudyCollab application! ðŸŽ‰
