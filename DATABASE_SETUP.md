# Database Schema and Authentication Setup - Task 2 Complete

This document summarizes the completion of Task 2: "Database Schema and Authentication Setup" for the StudyCollab MVP using **Supabase** as the database and authentication provider.

## ✅ Completed Components

### 1. Supabase Database Schema

**What was implemented:**

- Complete database schema with all required tables:

  - `notes` & `note_folders` - Note-taking with hierarchical folders
  - `resources` - File sharing and resource management
  - `votes` & `comments` - Community interaction features
  - `study_groups` & `group_members` - Collaboration features

**Key Features:**

- UUID primary keys for better scalability
- Proper foreign key relationships with cascade deletes
- Custom PostgreSQL enums for type safety
- JSONB content field for rich text notes (Tiptap compatible)
- Array fields for tags and flexible data storage
- Snake_case column naming following PostgreSQL conventions

### 2. Supabase Authentication Setup (`src/lib/supabase.ts`)

**What was implemented:**

- Modern Supabase client configuration using `@supabase/ssr`

- Service role client for admin operations
- Proper cookie handling for authentication state

**Key Features:**

- Browser client for client-side operations
- Server client for Server Components
- Service role client for admin tasks
- Backward compatibility with existing code

### 3. Authentication Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`)

**What was implemented:**

- Route protection for authenticated areas
- Automatic redirects for unauthenticated users
- Session refresh handling
- Protected route configuration

**Protected Routes:**

- `/dashboard` - Main user dashboard
- `/tasks` - Task management
- `/notes` - Note-taking
- `/resources` - Resource sharing
- `/groups` - Study groups
- `/profile` - User profile
- `/settings` - User settings

### 4. Database Migrations (`supabase/migrations/`)

**What was implemented:**

- `001_additional_tables.sql` - Complete database schema (works with existing profiles table)
- `002_rls_policies_additional.sql` - Row Level Security policies for new tables
- `003_additional_functions.sql` - Helper functions and triggers

**Key Features:**

- Works with your existing profiles table and auth setup
- Resource score calculation based on votes
- Prevention of self-voting on resources
- Comprehensive RLS policies for data security

### 5. Database Utilities (`src/lib/database.ts`)

**What was implemented:**

- Supabase client wrapper functions
- Error handling wrapper for database operations
- Connection testing utilities
- Proper error mapping for user-friendly messages

### 6. Authentication Library (`src/lib/auth.ts`)

**What was implemented:**

- Complete authentication API wrapper
- Client-side and server-side auth functions
- Authentication guards and utilities
- Error handling and user-friendly error messages

**Available Functions:**

- `auth.signUp()` - User registration
- `auth.signIn()` - User login
- `auth.signOut()` - User logout
- `auth.getUser()` - Get current user
- `authGuards.requireAuth()` - Authentication guard
- `authErrors.getErrorMessage()` - Error handling

### 7. TypeScript Types (`src/types/database.ts`)

**What was implemented:**

- Complete type definitions matching Supabase schema
- Form data types for create/update operations with snake_case fields
- API response types with error handling
- Filter and search parameter types

### 9. API Routes (`src/app/api/auth/user/route.ts`)

**What was implemented:**

- User profile retrieval endpoint
- User profile update endpoint
- Proper authentication checking
- Error handling and validation

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration

Your `.env.local` file should have the Supabase configuration:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://rvosteyajdubiwvvhitu.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### 2. Database Migration

Run the SQL migration files in your Supabase SQL Editor **in order**:

1. Execute `supabase/migrations/001_additional_tables.sql`
2. Execute `supabase/migrations/002_rls_policies_additional.sql`
3. Execute `supabase/migrations/003_additional_functions.sql`

**Note**: These migrations work with your existing `profiles` table and auth setup.

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)

- All tables have RLS enabled
- Users can only access their own data
- Public resources are accessible to all users
- Group-based access control for study groups

### Authentication Security

- Secure session management
- Automatic session refresh
- Protected route middleware
- CSRF protection through Supabase

### Data Validation

- Supabase schema validation
- TypeScript type safety
- Input sanitization in API routes
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

## 📊 Database Schema Overview

```
auth.users (Supabase managed)
├── profiles (your existing table)
    ├── task_categories
    ├── tasks
    ├── note_folders
    ├── notes
    ├── resources
    │   ├── votes
    │   └── comments
    └── study_groups
        └── group_members
```

## 🧪 Testing

The setup includes:

- Database connection tests using Supabase client
- Schema validation through TypeScript types
- RLS policy testing
- Authentication flow tests

Test your setup by running the migrations and verifying the tables are created correctly.

## 📝 Next Steps

With the database and authentication setup complete, you can now:

1. **Test the authentication flow** - Try signing up and logging in
2. **Verify protected routes** - Access `/dashboard` and other protected areas
3. **Test database operations** - Create tasks, notes, and resources
4. **Check RLS policies** - Ensure users can only see their own data
5. **Run the seed script** - Populate with sample data for development

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

- ✅ Supabase database schema matches design requirements
- ✅ Supabase authentication configured with proper client setup
- ✅ Row Level Security policies implemented for all tables
- ✅ Authentication middleware protecting routes
- ✅ Database utilities and error handling with Supabase client
- ✅ TypeScript types for all models with snake_case fields
- ✅ API routes for user management using Supabase
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation and setup guides

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Database Password**: You need to set the correct database password in `DATABASE_URL`
2. **Migration Order**: Run SQL migrations in the specified order
3. **RLS Policies**: Test that users can only access their own data
4. **Authentication**: Verify that protected routes redirect to login
5. **Error Handling**: Check that database errors are handled gracefully

The database schema and authentication setup is now complete and ready for the next development phase!
